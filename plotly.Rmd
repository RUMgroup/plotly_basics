## Plot.ly

- Data viz company. Trying to compete with likes of Tableau.
- Web service with a JavaScript plotting library at heart
- Cross platform interactive and editable charts
    - Add basic interactivity with little overhead
        - Great for exploration
        - As supplementary content? Embedded in journal websites?
    - plotly.js library open sourced late 2015
    - Online editing, collaboration, dashboards etc.
        - Excel online
        - Many more esoteric features
            - e.g. websockets
    - Vector plots, can use pixels for better performance (WebGL)
        - Can usually plot <1m 2d points without dramas
    - Actively maintained client libraries for Python, R, Matlab & JS
- Free version has limitations - no vector graphic export
    - But vector graphics aren't interactive?!
    - Student pricing 5$/mo

*Some plots are posted to the web for processing, but most plotting is now implemented in the client, and inside RStudio everything is done offline*

## Interactive scatter plots
``` {r}
head(diamonds) # example dataset
```

#### Basic 2d scatter
```{r scatter1, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
plot_ly(d, x = ~carat, y = ~price)
```

#### 2d scatter with marker size, colour and custom labels
```{r scatter2, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE}
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
plot_ly(d,
        x = ~carat,
        y = ~price,
        color = ~carat,
        size = ~carat,
        text = ~paste("Price: ", price, '$<br>Cut:', cut))
# Lots of information easily accessible, not overwhelming
```

#### As above, but using plotly_POST to share charts (requires a plot.ly account)
```
d <- diamonds[sample(nrow(diamonds), 1000), ]
c <- plot_ly(d,
             x = ~carat,
             y = ~price,
             color = ~carat,
             size = ~carat,
             text = ~paste("Price: ", price, '$<br>Cut:', cut))

chart_link = plotly_POST(c, filename="scatterer")
chart_link # returns URL of web chart
```

## Box and whisker
``` {r, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~price, color = ~cut, type = "box")
```

## Bubble plots

## ggplotly()
- Free interactivity for ggplot()  
``` {r, message=FALSE}
p <- ggplot(data = d, aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
     geom_point(aes(text = paste("Clarity:", clarity))) +
     geom_smooth(aes(colour = cut, fill = cut)) + facet_wrap(~ cut)

ggplotly(p)
```



## Chart type inference
- Instead of defaulting to a scatter trace, plot_ly() infers a sensible trace type based on provided data.
- e.g. if we supply a discrete variable to x (or y), we get a vertical (or horizontal) bar chart:
``` {r, message=FALSE}
subplot(
  plot_ly(diamonds, y = ~cut, color = ~clarity),
  plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, color = ~clarity),
  margin = 0.05
) %>% hide_legend() 
```
Or send discrete variables to both X and Y:
``` {r, message=FALSE}
plot_ly(diamonds, x = ~cut, y = ~clarity)
```
